# MASS
There are some samples of the subjective evaluation experiments of the paper MASS: Multi-task Anthropomorphic Speech Synthesis Framework. There are three folders: single-task voice conversion folder, dual-task voice synthesis folder and a folder for storing the synthesized voice of MASS framework. Each folder has some audio, which are generated by the method in this paper.
